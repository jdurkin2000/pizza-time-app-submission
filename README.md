Collaborators: Jimmy Durkin, Maulik Durani
Summary: 
Throughout the duration of the hackathon, we developed an app that fetches information from the Spotify API and displays a gallery of your top 9 songs and their album covers. We actually started to work on an alarm app that would allow the user to choose their ringtone from any song in Spotify. This turned out to be difficult as the hours went on, so we narrowed our scope to still be within the intermediate track's guidlines. We went through setbacks quite often, but the few times our code worked allowed us to better shape the direction in which our project production was going. I (maulik) worked on the visuals of the app and Jimmy worked on the logical (and more important) aspect of the project-- the API calls. At the end, we were able to get it done and the sheer relief after it all made it worthwhile. Jimmy says it did not.

I did not say that.
